# Getting Started with Knowder Development

## 🚀 Quick Setup

You now have a fully configured development environment for building the Knowder library! Here's what's been set up for you:

### ✅ What's Already Done

1. **Project Structure** - All folders and configuration files are in place
2. **Build System** - Rollup configured for ESM and UMD builds with aggressive optimization
3. **Testing** - Jest configured with ES module support
4. **Linting** - ESLint configured with performance-focused rules
5. **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions workflow with bundle size monitoring
6. **Basic API** - Skeleton implementation with singleton pattern

### 📁 Current Project Structure

```

├── src/
│   ├── core/           # Core modules (to be implemented)
│   ├── data/           # Default facts database (to be implemented)
│   └── index.js        # Main entry point (basic skeleton)
├── test/
│   └── knowder.test.js # Basic test suite
├── docs/
│   └── example.html    # Interactive demo
├── dist/               # Built files (auto-generated)
├── .github/workflows/  # CI/CD pipeline
└── Configuration files (package.json, rollup.config.js, etc.)
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Development workflow
npm run dev          # Start development with watch mode
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run lint:fix     # Fix linting issues

# Quality checks
npm run test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage
npm run size          # Check bundle size (currently ~422 bytes!)
npm run build         # Production build

# View the demo
open docs/example.html  # Open in browser
```

## 📋 Next Steps (Following the Roadmap)

### Phase 1: Complete Project Setup ✅ DONE
- [x] Repository structure
- [x] Build configuration  
- [x] CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Basic testing setup

### Phase 2: Core Data Layer (NEXT - Week 2)

**Your immediate tasks:**

1. **Create the default facts database** (`src/data/defaultFacts.js`):
   ```javascript
   export const DEFAULT_FACTS = {
     general: [
       "Honey never spoils - archaeologists have found edible honey in ancient Egyptian tombs.",
       // Add 14+ more engaging facts
     ],
     science: [
       "There are more possible games of chess than atoms in the observable universe.",
       // Add 14+ more science facts
     ],
     // Add technology and history categories
   };
   ```

2. **Implement fact storage system** (`src/core/factStorage.js`):
   - Random selection without repeats
   - Category management
   - Custom fact injection

3. **Write comprehensive tests** for the fact storage system

### Phase 3: Display Engine (Week 3)
- DOM manipulation with inline styles
- CSS-based animations (60fps target)
- Accessibility features

### Phase 4: Main API Implementation (Week 4)
- Complete the core FactLoader class
- Wire up all modules
- Full error handling

## 🎯 Critical Constraints to Remember

### Bundle Size Budget (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **HARD LIMIT**: <5KB gzipped
- Current size: ~422 bytes (excellent start!)
- Monitor with: `npm run size`

### Performance Targets
- Initialization: <50ms
- Memory usage: <1MB  
- Animation: 60fps maintained
- CPU impact: <1% during idle

### Code Quality Gates
- All tests must pass: `npm test`
- Bundle size <5KB: `npm run size`
- ESLint clean: `npm run lint`
- 90%+ test coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

## 🔧 Development Tips

### Following the Cursor Rules
- The `.cursorrules` file guides AI assistance
- Every decision evaluated through performance lens
- Zero external dependencies rule is absolute
- API must stay simple (max 3 main methods)

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
- Test in multiple browsers
- Include accessibility testing
- Performance regression testing

### Bundle Size Optimization
- Question every byte added
- Use native APIs only
- Optimize string literals
- Leverage tree shaking

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols

### If Bundle Size Exceeds 5KB
1. **STOP** all development immediately
2. Analyze what caused the increase
3. Remove/optimize offending code
4. Document decision rationale

### If Performance Regresses
1. Identify bottleneck with browser dev tools
2. Optimize critical path
3. Add performance test to prevent regression

## 📖 Resources

- **Technical Roadmap**: `TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md` - Complete 8-week plan
- **TODO List**: `TODO.md` - Detailed task breakdown
- **Demo**: `docs/example.html` - Interactive example
- **API Docs**: `README.md` - User-facing documentation

## 🎉 You're Ready to Build!

The foundation is solid. Start with Phase 2 (Core Data Layer) and follow the roadmap. The CI/CD pipeline will catch any issues, and the bundle size monitoring will keep you on track.

**Happy coding! 🧠⚡**
